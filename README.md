# Usage

## Local Environment Requirement

This project requires React with minimal version of 16.13.0 and thus, should install essential NPM packages prior to usage.

The following procedure assumes the node and npm have already been installed and are accessible from the commandline. For installation of node and npm, see [install node and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Install All The Necessary Package To The Project

Run the following command to install the packages:

```javascript
npm install
```

## Setting Up ESLint and Prettier To Work With This Project

For a good developer experience, it is useful to set the editor to automatically run ESLint's automatic repair commands when saving files.
To open your user and workspace settings, follow the following method:

On Windows/Linux - File > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Scroll down and find "Edit in settings.json"

On macOS - Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Scroll down and find "Edit in settings.json"

You can also open the Settings editor from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) with Preferences: Open Settings or use the keyboard shortcut (⌘,), or see [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to get more information.

Now, You should have an open file to execute it. If you don’t want to format the file manually every time, you can also format it when saving. Therefore, you need to open the settings/preferences of Visual Studio Code users in JSON format and configure the following:

```javascript
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "typescript"
  ],
}
```
